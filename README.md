# DecoAR
## Problem Statement  (FINTECH THEME)

- *Traditional home decor shopping is often challenging and time-consuming.
- *Customers struggle to visualize how furniture and decor items will fit into their space.
- *Our solution leverages augmented reality to address these issues.

## Solution/Product Brief

- *AR Home Decor App offers a seamless and immersive shopping experience.
- *Users can place and interact with virtual furniture and decor in their real environment.
- *It enhances informed decision-making and eliminates guesswork for customers.
### An Android Application-:
Created an Android app that allows users to register and store their data in Firebase. Users can log in, access their profiles, and integrate with Unity for room decoration. The app also supports product purchases

### An Augmented Reality Application-:
Creating a Unity 3D application in which the user first opens the camera, then selects the first furniture. After clicking the back button, the user can select the second furniture. Then, by clicking the back button again, the user can select the third furniture. Once all types of integrations are completed, the user can place all three furniture from their own.


### A Website-:
Developed a promotional webpage for the app and Unity integration, enabling users to install the app and view Funtiture/Decor  product examples. The webpage showcases images that will be featured in the app, serving as a promotional tool.
